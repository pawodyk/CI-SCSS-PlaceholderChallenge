# SCSS-Chalange-Placeholder

## Instructions

Your challenge is to review a code snippet and improve it. Open the file called [challenge3.scss](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/scss_challenges/blob/37dc49071ec59a7ac7a2f79d1a8e349154154439/challenge%203/challenge3.scss).

Is something wrong with this code? How can we improve it? Is something repetitive? Maybe a straightforward placeholder can help us out...
